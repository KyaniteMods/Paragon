### Lightweight and easy-to-use config library. Used in Deeper and Darker, and Golems of All Types. Created by Kyanite Mods with ðŸ’–

## Advantages of using Paragon:
- Lightweight and modular, Paragon itself is just a config library for other mods to use. It does not add any in-game content (such as menus, GUIs, etc)
- Super easy to use and setup
- Modern and simple
